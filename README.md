This repository contains the lab assignments for the course Machine Learning Operations, which is part of the [Bachelor Applied Computer Science programme](https://www.hogent.be/opleidingen/bachelors/toegepaste-informatica/) at [HOGENT](https://www.hogent.be/).

The goal of these assignments is to get familiar with concepts like container virtualization, CI/CD, monitoring, etc. in the context of Machine Learning Operations.

This repository contains some scaffolding code, based on [ansible-skeleton](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-skeleton), a framework for quickly setting up an Ansible development and testing environment powered by [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com).

- [dockerlab](dockerlab/): sets up a VM to experiment with container virtualization.
