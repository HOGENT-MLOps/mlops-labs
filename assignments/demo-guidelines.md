# Demo Guidelines for MLOps Labs

This document provides general guidelines and best practices for demonstrating your MLOps lab assignments.

## ðŸŽ¯ General Demo Preparation

### Before Your Demo

**Technical Setup:**
- [ ] Ensure all services are running and accessible
- [ ] Have all required URLs bookmarked and ready
- [ ] Prepare sample data and test inputs
- [ ] Test all commands beforehand to avoid errors
- [ ] Have backup plans for common issues

**Documentation Ready:**
- [ ] Lab report completed with all sections
- [ ] All questions answered
- [ ] Screenshots and results included
- [ ] Code pushed to repository

**Presentation Setup:**
- [ ] Screen sharing configured
- [ ] Terminal windows organized
- [ ] Browser tabs prepared
- [ ] Notes ready for key points to explain

### During Your Demo

**Structure Your Presentation:**
1. **Overview** (2-3 minutes)
   - Briefly explain what the lab covers
   - Show the main components you built

2. **Technical Demonstration** (10-15 minutes)
   - Walk through each acceptance criteria item
   - Explain what you're doing as you do it
   - Show both success and error cases when relevant

3. **Key Learnings** (2-3 minutes)
   - Highlight the most important concepts
   - Explain challenges you faced and how you solved them

**Best Practices:**
- **Explain as you go**: Don't just show results, explain the process
- **Be prepared for questions**: Understand the underlying concepts
- **Show the full workflow**: From setup to final results
- **Demonstrate troubleshooting**: If something breaks, show how you fix it
- **Keep it interactive**: Ask if the audience has questions

## ðŸ“‹ Lab-Specific Demo Tips

### Lab 1: Docker
- **Show the process**: Build â†’ Run â†’ Test â†’ Push
- **Explain Docker concepts**: Images, containers, layers, networking
- **Demonstrate both Flask and Triton**: Show the difference
- **Use Portainer effectively**: Show container management features

### Lab 3: ML Workflow
- **Show both dashboards**: Prefect and MLFlow running simultaneously
- **Explain the pipeline**: Each task and its purpose
- **Demonstrate model registry**: Show model versioning and prediction
- **Show the data flow**: From raw data to predictions

### Lab 4: Quantization & Pruning
- **Compare file sizes**: Before and after optimization
- **Show performance metrics**: Accuracy vs. size trade-offs
- **Explain the techniques**: Why quantization and pruning work
- **Demonstrate the notebook**: All cells executed with outputs

### Lab 5: Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Show TensorBoard**: Visualize the tuning process
- **Compare results**: With and without tuning
- **Explain the tuners**: RandomSearch vs. Hyperband
- **Show best parameters**: What the tuner found

### Lab 6: Monitoring
- **Show the full stack**: Model â†’ Prometheus â†’ Grafana â†’ Discord
- **Demonstrate alerts**: Both firing and resolving
- **Show real-time updates**: Dashboards refreshing
- **Explain the architecture**: How all components work together

## ðŸš¨ Common Demo Pitfalls to Avoid

**Technical Issues:**
- Don't start with broken services
- Don't skip error handling demonstrations
- Don't rush through complex setups
- Don't forget to show the "why" behind decisions

**Presentation Issues:**
- Don't just show final results without process
- Don't skip explaining key concepts
- Don't ignore questions from the audience
- Don't make assumptions about audience knowledge

**Preparation Issues:**
- Don't demo without testing everything first
- Don't forget to have backup plans
- Don't skip the documentation requirements
- Don't ignore the acceptance criteria

## ðŸ“Š Demo Checklist Template

Use this checklist for each lab demo:

### Pre-Demo Checklist
- [ ] All services running and accessible
- [ ] Lab report completed and pushed
- [ ] All acceptance criteria items ready to demonstrate
- [ ] Sample data and test cases prepared
- [ ] Screenshots and documentation ready

### During Demo Checklist
- [ ] Explain the lab objectives
- [ ] Show environment setup
- [ ] Demonstrate each acceptance criteria item
- [ ] Explain key concepts and decisions
- [ ] Show troubleshooting if needed
- [ ] Answer questions clearly
- [ ] Summarize key learnings

### Post-Demo Checklist
- [ ] All code pushed to repository
- [ ] Lab report includes all required sections
- [ ] Screenshots and results documented
- [ ] Questions answered in report
- [ ] Cheat sheet updated if applicable

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

**For Better Demos:**
- Practice the demo beforehand
- Have a backup plan for each step
- Keep notes of common questions and answers
- Show enthusiasm for the technology
- Connect concepts to real-world applications

**For Technical Issues:**
- Know how to restart services quickly
- Have alternative approaches ready
- Don't panic if something breaks - use it as a learning opportunity
- Keep logs handy for troubleshooting

**For Documentation:**
- Take screenshots during the demo
- Note any issues or solutions discovered
- Update your report with demo insights
- Keep a record of questions asked

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Objectives

Remember that demos are not just about showing that you completed the lab, but about demonstrating that you understand:

- **The technology**: How the tools work
- **The concepts**: Why these approaches are used
- **The process**: How to implement MLOps practices
- **The challenges**: What problems these tools solve
- **The applications**: How this applies to real projects

Good luck with your demos! ðŸš€
